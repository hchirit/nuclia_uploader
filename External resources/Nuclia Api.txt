This is the information relative to Developer tools of nuclia 

1. Introduction:
All Nuclia features are available through its APIs. It covers all the steps from data ingestion to search and RAG.

To simplify the development process, Nuclia provides two Software Development Kits (SDKs):

Python SDK: It allows you to call the Nuclia API from a Python script, or to integrate Nuclia in popular Python web frameworks like Django. It also comes with a command-line interface (CLI) for enhanced usability.
JavaScript/TypeScript SDK: It allows to integrate Nuclia in your frontend application, like React, Next.js, Angular, Vue.js, Svelte, etc.
These SDKs serve as wrappers for the API. While we strive to keep them up-to-date, the API will always have the latest features.
